The purpose of this project is to provide a fast and efficient dynamic news discussion platform where users have a limited amount of time to exchange their thoughts on current topics. The project aims to encourage efficient exchange of information in a limited amount of time, as opposed to allowing users to select their own news within an unlimited time and scope. In a live chat room, the topic of the chat will automatically switch over time. The topic title, image, and source will be displayed on the chat page.
